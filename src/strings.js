/**
 * Returns a string produced according to the formatting string fmt.
 * @method String.sprintf
 * @param {String} fmt The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (excluding %) that are copied directly to the result, and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching its own parameter.
 * <ul style="list-style:none;">
 * <li>% - a literal percent character. No argument is required.
 * <li>b - the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as a binary number.
 * <li>c - the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as the character with that ASCII value.
 * <li>d - the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as a (signed) decimal number.
 * <li>e - the argument is treated as scientific notation (e.g. 1.2e+2). The precision specifier stands for the number of digits after the decimal point since PHP 5.2.1. In earlier versions, it was taken as number of significant digits (one less).
 * <li>E - like %e but uses uppercase letter (e.g. 1.2E+2).
 * <li>f - the argument is treated as a float, and presented as a floating-point number (locale aware).
 * <li>F - the argument is treated as a float, and presented as a floating-point number (non-locale aware). Available since PHP 4.3.10 and PHP 5.0.3.
 * <li>g - shorter of %e and %f.
 * <li>G - shorter of %E and %f.
 * <li>o - the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as an octal number.
 * <li>s - the argument is treated as and presented as a string.
 * <li>u - the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as an unsigned decimal number.
 * <li>x - the argument is treated as an integer and presented as a hexadecimal number (with lowercase letters).
 * <li>X - the argument is treated as an integer and presented as a hexadecimal number (with uppercase letters).
 * </ul>
 * @returns {String} The formatted string.
