 * Translate the language key in the active language.
 * @method widget#getLocalizedString
 * @param {String} key Translation key.

 * * d - the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as a (signed) decimal number.
 * * e - the argument is treated as scientific notation (e.g. 1.2e+2). The precision specifier stands for the number of digits after the decimal point.
 * * E - like %e but uses uppercase letter (e.g. 1.2E+2).
 * * f - the argument is treated as a float, and presented as a floating-point number.
 * * F - the argument is treated as a float, and presented as a floating-point number.
 * * g - shorter of %e and %f.
 * * G - shorter of %E and %f.
 * * o - the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as an octal number.
 * * s - the argument is treated as and presented as a string.
 * * u - the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as an unsigned decimal number.
 * * x - the argument is treated as an integer and presented as a hexadecimal number (with lowercase letters).
 * * X - the argument is treated as an integer and presented as a hexadecimal number (with uppercase letters).
 * @returns {String} The translated string or the key.
 * @example <caption>The below code lines do the same:</caption>

 * $_('close_button');
 *
 * //Translation string:
 * //"nrMonkeys" = "There are %d monkeys in the %s.";
 * widget.getLocalizedString('nrMonkeys', [2, 'tree']); // Returns -> There are 2 monkeys in the tree.
